# iReSign
Modified iReSign based on https://github.com/maciekish/iReSign. Enabled version update.

iReSign allows iDevice app bundles (.ipa) files to be signed or resigned with a digital certificate from Apple for distribution. It can also create signed iDevice app bundles (.ipa) files from .xcarchive files. This tool is aimed at enterprises users, for enterprise deployment, when the person signing the app is different than the person(s) developing it.

Because I am not a Mac developer and could not produce a package, XCode is required to run this program in debug mode. 

This copy is not meant to take any credit. I just did not know how to do a pull request to offer the modification to the original author. Please join me to thank Maciekish for this fabulous tool.
